# Bricked Foundry

Adds molten stone, casting stone brick and casting rail recipe to the foundry.

Tries to be as close to vanilla balancing as possible:

- 50 stone + 1 calcite = 500 molten stone
- 80 molten stone = 4 bricks

---

- 199 molten iron, 21 stone for 42 rails in vanilla
- 200 molten iron and (10 bricks/20 stone/400 molten stone) divided by 20 = 10 molten iron, 20 molten stone = 2 rails
- Crafting speed assembly machine 2 to foundry is usually 4 times the amount per second
- 3/s in assembly machine 2, 12/s in foundry

Complementary mods I use:

[Foundry Expanded](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/foundry-expanded)

[Concrete Productivity Modified](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/concrete-productivity-modified)

Why? I just want to use foundries for everything.
